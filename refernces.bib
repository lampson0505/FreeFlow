  Abstract                 = {The multiplication of cores in today’s architectures raises the importance of intra-node communication in modern clusters and their impact on the overall parallel application performance. Although several proposals focused on this issue in the past, there is still a need for a portable and hardware-independent solution that addresses the requirements of both point-to-point and collective \{MPIoperations\} inside shared-memory computing nodes. This paper presents the KNEM module for the Linux kernel that provides MPI implementations with a flexible and scalable interface for performing kernel-assisted single-copy data transfers between local processes. It enables high-performance communication within most existing MPI implementations and brings significant application performance improvements thanks to more efficient point-to-point and collective operations. },

  Abstract                 = {<p>Hybrid parallel programming with the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for internode communication in conjunction with a shared-memory programming model to manage intranode parallelism has become a dominant approach to scalable parallel programming. While this model provides a great deal of flexibility and performance potential, it saddles programmers with the complexity of utilizing two parallel programming systems in the same application. We introduce an MPI-integrated shared-memory programming model that is incorporated into MPI through a small extension to the one-sided communication interface. We discuss the integration of this interface with the MPI 3.0 one-sided semantics and describe solutions for providing portable and efficient data sharing, atomic operations, and memory consistency. We describe an implementation of the new interface in the MPICH2 and Open MPI implementations and demonstrate an average performance improvement of 40\% to the communication component of a five-point stencil solver.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Although InfiniBand Architecture is relatively new in the high performance computing area, it offers many features which help us to improve the performance of communication subsystems. One of these features is Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) operations. In this paper, we propose a new design of MPI over InfiniBand which brings the benefit of RDMA to not only large messages, but also small and control messages. We also achieve better scalability by exploiting application communication pattern and combining send/receive operations with RDMA operations. Our RDMA-based MPI implementation achieves a latency of 6.8 $\mu$sec for small messages and a peak bandwidth of 871 million bytes/sec. Performance evaluation shows that for small messages, our RDMA-based design can reduce the latency by 24{\%}, increase the bandwidth by over 104{\%}, and reduce the host overhead by up to 22{\%} compared with the original design. For large data transfers, we improve performance by reducing the time for transferring control messages. We have also shown that our new design is beneficial to MPI collective communication and NAS Parallel Benchmarks.},
