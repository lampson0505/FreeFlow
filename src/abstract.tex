\textbf{Abstract---} 
With the tremendous popularity gained by container technology, many applications are being containerized:
splitting into numerous containers connected by networks. However, current container networking solutions
have either bad performance or poor portability, which undermines the advantages of containerization.
In this paper, we propose \sysname, a container networking solution which achieves both high performance
and good portability. \sysname is designed according to the observation that strict isolations are unnecessary 
among containers trusting each other, and it can significantly boost the communication quality of containers by 
compromising isolation a little bit. Specifically, we enable containers on the same physical machine
to communicate via shared-memory and the ones on different physical machines communicate via
high performance networking options, e.g. RDMA and DPDK. Naively wrapping up all the solutions
together will result in poor potability of containers and huge complexity in application development.
Instead, \sysname leverages a network abstraction which supports all common network APIs and 
a centralized network orchestrator which decides how to deliver data transparently to applications in the containers.
