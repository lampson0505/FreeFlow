\textbf{Inter-VM Communication:} 
The tussle between isolation and performance is not unique to containers.
In the field of Inter-VM Communication, there are several works that provides
high-performance by removing some of the isolation constraints.
For example, NetVM\cite{netvm} provides a shared-memory framework that
exploits the DPDK library to provide zero-copy delivery between VMs.
Netmap\cite{netmap} and VALE\cite{vale} (which is also used by ClickOS\cite{clickos}) 
are sharing buffers and metadata between kernel and userspace to eliminate memory copies.
However, these works actually strengthened the binding between VM and underlying host
structures, thus they cannot satisfy the portability requirement for \sysname. 
Also, there works is applicable only to intra-host setting, constrained by the possibility
of shared memory.
