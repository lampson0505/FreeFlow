\textbf{Live migration:} 
This work is not focusing on live migration, but we envision that \sysname could be a key enabler
for containers to achieve both high-performance and capability for live migration.
Previously, high-performance mechanisms such as RDMA lacks the capability for live migration because
the container is bond to the underlying network structure or hardware of the host.
For example, containers have to be bond to the IP or port of the host to enable RDMA.
However, \sysname virtualized the underlying network structure or hardware with the vNIC design.
Since vNIC decouples the binding between containers and host structure, 
now containers can be live migrated along vNIC.

\textbf{Security and middle-box:}
One valid concern for \sysname is how legacy can middle-boxes work for communication
vi shared-memory or RDMA, and whether security will be broken by using shared-memory or RDMA.
For security, \sysname would only allow shared-memory among trusted containers, for example,
container belongs to the same vendor (e.g., running spark or storm).
For supporting middle-boxes (e.g. IDS/IPS), we acknowledge that further work needs to be done
to enable them in this new communication paradigm.


\textbf{VM environment:}
So far our evaluation and prototype is based on containers running on bare-metal. 
But we believe our design is also general for containers deployed inside VMs, and 
we will extend our prototype to support this case in future works.
