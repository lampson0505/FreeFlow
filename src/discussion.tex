\textbf{Live migration:} 


\textbf{Security and middle-box:}
One valid concern for \sysname is how legacy can middle-boxes work for communication
vi shared-memory or RDMA, and whether security will be broken by using shared-memory or RDMA.
For security, \sysname would only allow shared-memory among trusted containers, for example,
container belongs to the same vendor (e.g., running spark or storm). 


\textbf{VM environment:}
So far our evaluation and prototype is based on containers running on bare-metal. 
Although we believe our design is also general for containers deployed inside VMs,
the VM environment can brought in further challenges such as how to handle the
address mapping, how to enable shared-memory/RDMA or how to locate the containers
and measure the utility of resources. We will address these challenges in our futureworks.
%\textbf{Network trouble shooting:}
